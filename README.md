# DSSP - Defensec SELinux Security Policy

What started as a research project of SELinux Common Intermediate Language (CIL), and its compiler to identify their defining properties developed into a project to scratch an itch. The realization that CIL policy can be a compelling substitute for common module policy by solving existing problems, and by building on years of experience inspired the author to maintain DSSP. The project can be summarized as "back to basics", and DSSP aims to define itself by its enhanced accessibility and flexibility.
